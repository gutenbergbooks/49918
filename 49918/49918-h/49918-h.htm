<h1>THE LAND OF PROMISE</h1>

<h2><a name="ACT_I" id="ACT_I"></a>ACT I</h2>

<div class="blockquott"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>The drawing-room at Miss Wickham’s house in Tunbridge
Wells. It is a room in which there is too much furniture. There are
armchairs covered with faded chintz, little tables here and there,
cabinets containing china, a great many photographs in silver
frames, porcelain ornaments wherever there is a vacant space,
Chippendale chairs and chairs from the Tottenham Court Road. There
are flowers in vases and growing plants. The wall-paper has a
pattern of enormous chrysanthemums, and on the walls are a large
number of old-fashioned watercolours in gilt frames. There is one
door, which leads into the hall; and a French window opens on to
the garden. The window is decorated with white lace curtains. It is
four o’clock in the afternoon. The sun is streaming through the
drawn blinds. There is a wreath of white flowers in a cardboard box
on one of the chairs. The door is opened by</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span>, <i>the
parlour-maid. She is of respectable appearance and of a decent age.
She admits</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Pringle</span>. <span class="smcap">Miss Pringle</span> <i>is companion to a wealthy
old lady in Tunbridge Wells. She is a woman of middle age, plainly
dressed, thin and narrow of shoulders, with a weather-beaten, tired
face and grey hair.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>I’ll tell Miss Marsh you’re here, Miss Pringle.<a name="page_002" id="page_002"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>How is she to-day, Kate?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>She’s tired out, poor thing. She’s lying down now. But I’m sure she’d
like to see you, Miss.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I’m very glad she didn’t go to the funeral.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>Dr. Evans thought she’d better stay at home, Miss, and Mrs. Wickham said
she’d only upset herself if she went.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I wonder how she stood it all those months, waiting on Miss Wickham hand
and foot.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>Miss Wickham wouldn’t have a professional nurse. And you know what she
was, Miss.... Miss Marsh slept in Miss Wickham’s room, and the moment
she fell asleep Miss Wickham would have her up because her pillow wanted
shaking, or she was thirsty, or something.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I suppose she was very inconsiderate.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>Inconsiderate isn’t the word, Miss. I wouldn’t be a lady’s companion,
not for anything. What they have to put up with!<a name="page_003" id="page_003"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Oh, well, everyone isn’t like Miss Wickham. The lady I’m companion to,
Mrs. Hubbard, is kindness itself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>That sounds like Miss Marsh coming downstairs [<i>She goes to the door and
opens it.</i>] Miss Pringle is here, Miss.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Norah</span> <i>comes in. She is a woman of twenty-eight, with a pleasant,
honest face and a happy smile. She is gentle, with quiet manners,
but she has a quick temper, under very good control, and a
passionate nature which is hidden under a demure appearance. She is
simply dressed in black.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I <i>am</i> glad to see you. I was hoping you’d be able to come here this
afternoon.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hubbard has gone for a drive with somebody or other, and didn’t
want me.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>They kiss one another.</i> <span class="smcap">Norah</span> <i>notices the wreath</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What’s this?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>It didn’t arrive till after they’d started, Miss.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I wonder whom it’s from. [<i>She looks at a card which is attached to the
wreath.</i>] “From Mrs. Alfred<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a> Vincent, with deepest regret for my dear
Miss Wickham and heartiest sympathy for her sorrowing relatives.”</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>Sorrowing relatives is good, Miss.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Remonstrating.</i>] Kate ... I think you’d better take it away.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>What shall I do with it, Miss?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I’m going to the cemetery a little later. I’ll take it with me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>Very good, Miss.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>takes up the box and goes out</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>You haven’t been crying, Norah?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little apologetic smile.</i>] Yes, I couldn’t help it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>What on earth for?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>My dear, it’s not unnatural.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Well, I don’t want to say anything against her now she’s dead and gone,
poor thing, but Miss Wickham was the most detestable old woman I ever
met.<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I don’t suppose one can live all that time with anyone and not be a
little sorry to part with them for ever. I was Miss Wickham’s companion
for ten years.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>How you stood it! Exacting, domineering, disagreeable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I suppose she was. Because she paid me a salary she thought I
wasn’t a human being. I never saw anyone with such a bitter tongue. At
first I used to cry every night when I went to bed because of the things
she said to me. But I got used to them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I wonder you didn’t leave her. I would have.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>It’s not easy to get posts as lady’s companion.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>That’s true. They tell me the agents’ books are full of people wanting
situations. Before I went to Mrs. Hubbard I was out of one for nearly
two years.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>It’s not so bad for you. You can always go and stay with your brother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>You’ve got a brother too.<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Yes, but he’s farming in Canada. He had all he could do to keep himself,
he couldn’t keep me too.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>How is he doing now?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh, he’s doing very well. He’s got a farm of his own. He wrote over a
couple of years ago and told me he could always give me a home if I
wanted one.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Canada’s so far off.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Not when you get there.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Why don’t you draw the blinds?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I thought I ought to wait till they come back from the funeral.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>It must be a great relief to you now it’s all over.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Sometimes I can’t realise it. These last few weeks I hardly got to bed
at all, and when the end came I was utterly exhausted. For two days I
could do nothing but sleep. Poor Miss Wickham. She did hate dying.<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>That’s the extraordinary part of it. I believe you were really fond of
her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>D’you know that for nearly a year she would eat nothing but what I gave
her with my own hands. And she liked me as much as she was capable of
liking anybody.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>That wasn’t much.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>And then, I was so dreadfully sorry for her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Good heavens!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>She’d been a hard and selfish woman all her life, and there was no one
who cared for her. It seemed so dreadful to die like that and leave not
a soul to regret one. Her nephew and his wife were just waiting for her
death. It was dreadful. Each time they came down from London I saw them
looking at her to see if she was any worse than when last they’d seen
her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Well, I thought her a horrid old woman, and I’m glad she’s dead. And I
hope she’s left you well provided for.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] Oh, I think she’s done that. Two years ago when I
nearly went away she said she’d left me enough to live upon.<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>You mean when that assistant of Dr. Evans wanted to marry you? I’m glad
you wouldn’t have him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>He was very nice. But, of course, he wasn’t a gentleman.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I shouldn’t like to live with a man at all; I think they’re horrid, but,
of course, it would be impossible if he weren’t a gentleman.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a twinkle in her eye.</i>] He came to see Miss Wickham, but she
wouldn’t have anything to do with him. First she said that she couldn’t
spare me, and then she said that I had a very bad temper.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I like <i>her</i> saying that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>It’s quite true. Every now and then I felt I couldn’t put up with her
any more. I forgot that I was dependent on her, and if she dismissed me
I probably shouldn’t be able to find another situation, and I just flew
at her. I must say she was very nice about it; she used to look at me
and grin, and, when it was all over, say: “My dear, when you marry, if
your husband’s a wise man, he’ll use a big stick now and then.”</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Old cat.<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I should like to see a man try.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>How much d’you think she’s left you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Well, of course, I don’t know; the will is going to be read this
afternoon when they come back from the funeral, but from what she said I
believe about two hundred and fifty a year.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>It’s the least she could do. She’s had the ten best years of your life.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a sigh of relief.</i>] I shall never be at anybody’s beck and call
again. I shall be able to get up when I like and go to bed when I like,
go out when I choose, and come in when I choose.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Drily.</i>] You’ll probably marry.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Never.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Then what’ll you do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I shall go to Italy, Florence, Rome. D’you think it’s horrible of me,
I’m so happy?<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>My dear child.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>There is a sound of carriage wheels on the drive.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>There they are.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I’d better go, hadn’t I?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid you must.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I do so want to know about the will. Can’t I go up to your room and wait
there?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>No. I’ll tell you what, go and sit in the garden. They want to catch the
four something back to London, and we can have a cosy little tea all by
ourselves.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Very well. Oh, my dear, I’m so happy in your good luck.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Take care.</p>

<p>Quite a lot. The sort of people who indulge in other people’s funerals
as a mild form of dissipation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at his watch.</i>] I hope Wynne will look sharp. I don’t want to
miss that train.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>Who were all those stodgy old things who wrung your hand afterwards,
Jim?<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>I can’t think. They made me feel such a fool.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>Oh, was that it? I saw you looking a perfect owl, and I thought you were
giving a very bad imitation of restrained emotion.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Remonstrating.</i>] Dorothy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Would you like some tea, Mrs. Wickham?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>Well, you might send some in so that it’ll be ready when Mr. Wynne
comes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Norah</span> <i>is just going to ring the bell, but</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wickham</span> <i>stops
her with a pleasant smile</i>.]</p></div>

<p>We’ll ring for you, shall we? I daresay you’ve got one or two things you
want to do now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Very good, Mrs. Wickham.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She goes out.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>I say, Dorothy, you oughtn’t to be facetious before Miss Marsh. She was
extremely attached to Aunt Louisa.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>Oh, what nonsense! It’s always a very good rule to judge people by
oneself, and I’m positive she was just longing for the old lady to die.<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>She was awfully upset at the end.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>Nerves! Men are so idiotic. They never understand that there are tears
<i>and</i> tears. I cried myself, and heaven knows I didn’t regret her death.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>My dear Dorothy, you oughtn’t to say that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>Why not? It’s perfectly true. Aunt Louisa was a detestable person and no
one would have stood her for a minute if she hadn’t had money. I don’t
see any use in being a hypocrite now that it can’t make any difference
either way.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at his watch again.</i>] I wish Wynne would hurry up. It’ll be
beastly inconvenient if we miss that train.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>I don’t trust Miss Marsh. She looks as if she knew what was in the will.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>I don’t suppose she does. Aunt Louisa wasn’t the sort of person to talk.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>I’m sure she knows she’s been left something.<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>Oh, well, I think she has a right to expect that. Aunt Louisa led her a
dog’s life.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>She had wages and a comfortable home. If she didn’t like the place she
could have left it.... After all it’s family money. I don’t think Aunt
Louisa had the right to leave it to strangers.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>We oughtn’t to complain if Miss Marsh gets a small annuity. Aunt Louisa
promised her something of the sort when she had a chance of marrying a
couple of years ago.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>Miss Marsh is quite young. It isn’t as if she’d been here for thirty
years.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>Well, I’ve got an idea that Aunt Louisa meant to leave her about two
hundred and fifty a year.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>But what’s the estate?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>About nineteen thousand pounds, I believe.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>Oh, it’s absurd. It’s a most unfair proportion. It makes all the
difference to us. On that extra two hundred and fifty a year we could
almost keep a car.<a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>My dear, be thankful if we get anything at all.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Aghast.</i>] Jim! [<i>She stares at him.</i>] Jim, you don’t think! Oh! That
would be too horrible.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>Take care.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>The door opens and</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>brings in the tea-things. She puts them

<p>How lucky it is we had a fine day, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>It looks as if we were going to have a spell of fine weather.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>It’s funny how often it rains for weddings.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>Very funny.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span>.]</p></div>

<p>I’ve been counting on that money for years. I used to dream at night
that I was reading a telegram with the news of Aunt Louisa’s death. And
I’ve thought of all we should be able to do when we got it. It’ll make
such a difference.<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>You know what she was. She didn’t care two-pence for us. We ought to be
prepared for the worst.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>D’you think she could have left everything to Miss Marsh?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>I shouldn’t be surprised.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>We’ll dispute the will. It’s undue influence. I suspected Miss Marsh
from the beginning. I hate her. Oh, why doesn’t Wynne come?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>There is a ring at the bell.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>Here he is, I expect.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>The suspense is too awful.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>Pull yourself together, old girl. And I say, look a bit dismal. After
all, we’ve just come from a funeral.</p>

<p>No, I know. But it must have been a great shock all the same.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>My wife was very much upset, but of course my poor aunt had suffered
great pain, and we couldn’t help looking upon it as a happy release.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>How pretty the garden is looking now.</p>

<p>[<i>Abruptly.</i>] Very.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>Miss Wickham was always so interested in her garden.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>Yes.<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Wynne has brought the will with him.<a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a></p>

<p>Oh, yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>Miss Marsh, so far as you know, there’s no other will?</p>

<p>How d’you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>Miss Wickham didn’t make a later one&mdash;without my assistance, I mean? You
know of nothing in the house, for instance?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quite decidedly.</i>] Oh, no. Miss Wickham always said you had her will.
She was extremely methodical.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>I feel I ought to ask because she consulted me about making a fresh will
a couple of years ago. She told me what she wanted to do, but gave me no
actual instructions to draw it. I thought perhaps she might have done it
herself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I heard nothing about it. I’m sure that her only will is in your hands.</p>

<p>When was that will made?</p>

<p>Eight or nine years ago.... The exact date was March 4th, 1904.</p>

<p>When did you first come to Miss Wickham?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>At the end of nineteen hundred and three.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>There is a slight pause.</i>]</p></div>

<p>Shall I read it, or would you just like to know the particulars? It is
very short.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>Let us just know roughly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>Well, Miss Wickham left one hundred pounds to the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel, and one hundred pounds to the General
Hospital at Tunbridge Wells, and the entire residue of her fortune to
her nephew, Mr. James Wickham.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> <i>gives a sharp inspiration of triumph. She looks again at</i>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>And Miss Marsh?<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>Miss Marsh is not mentioned.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a faint smile.</i>] I could hardly expect to be. At the time the
will was drawn I had been Miss Wickham’s companion for only a few
months.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>That is why I asked whether you knew of any later will. When I talked to
Miss Wickham on the subject she said her wish was to make adequate
provision for you after her death. I think she had spoken to you about
it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>She mentioned three hundred a year.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>That was very kind of her. I’m glad she wished to do something for me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>Oddly enough she spoke about it to Dr. Evans only a few days before she
died.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps there <i>is</i> a later will somewhere?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>I honestly don’t think so.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I’m sure there isn’t.<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>Dr. Evans was talking to Miss Wickham about Miss Marsh. She was tired
out and he wanted Miss Wickham to have a professional nurse. She told
him then that I had the will and she had left Miss Marsh amply provided
for.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quickly.</i>] That isn’t legal, of course?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>What isn’t?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>I mean, no one could force us&mdash;I mean, the will stands as it is, doesn’t
it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>Certainly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid it’s a great disappointment to you, Miss Marsh.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Lightly.</i>] I never count my chickens before they’re hatched.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>It would be very natural if Miss Marsh were disappointed under the
circumstances. I think she’d been led to expect....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] Our aunt left a very small fortune, I understand, and
I suppose she felt it wouldn’t be fair to leave a large part of it away
from her own family.<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>Of course, it is family money; she inherited it from my grandfather, and
... but I want you to know, Miss Marsh, that my wife and I thoroughly
appreciate all you did for my aunt. Money couldn’t repay your care and
devotion. You’ve been perfectly wonderful.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>It’s extremely good of you to say so. I was very fond of Miss Wickham.
Nothing I did for her was any trouble.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>I think everyone who saw Miss Marsh with Miss Wickham must be aware that
during the ten years she was with her she never spared herself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hesitatingly, with a glance at his wife.</i>] Of course, my aunt was a
very trying woman.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Agreeably.</i>] Earning one’s living is always unpleasant. If it weren’t
there’d be no incentive to work.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>My wife and I would be very glad to make some kind of acknowledgment of
your services.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>I was just going to mention it.<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Wynne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Brightening a little.</i>] I felt sure that under the circumstances....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting him quickly.</i>] What were your wages, Miss Marsh?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Thirty pounds a year.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span></p>

<p>Really? Many ladies are glad to go as companion without any salary, just
for the sake of a home and congenial society. I daresay you’ve been able
to save a good deal in all these years.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Not a penny! Oh, it’s cruel. After all, there was no need for her to
leave me anything. She gave me board and lodging and thirty pounds a
year. If I stayed it was because I chose. She needn’t have promised me
anything. She needn’t have prevented me from marrying.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>My dear, you could never have married the little assistant. He wasn’t a
gentleman.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Ten years! The ten best years of a woman’s life, when other girls are
enjoying themselves. And what did I get for it? Board and lodging and
thirty pounds a year. A cook does better than that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>We can’t expect to make so much money as a good cook. One has to pay
something for living like a lady among people of one’s own class.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh, it’s cruel.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Trying to console her.</i>] My dear, don’t give way. I’m sure you’ll have
no difficulty in finding another situation. You wash lace beautifully,
and no one can arrange flowers like you.<a name="page_030" id="page_030"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I was dreaming of France and Italy.... I shall spend ten years more with
an old lady, and then she’ll die, and I shall look out for another
situation. It won’t be so easy then because I shan’t be so young. And so
it’ll go on till I can’t find a situation because I’m too old, and some
charitable people will get me into a home. You like the life, don’t you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>My dear, there are so few things a gentlewoman can do.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>When I think of these ten years! Having to put up with every
unreasonableness! Never being allowed to feel ill or tired! No servant
would have stood what I have. The humiliation I’ve endured!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>You’re tired and out of sorts. Everyone isn’t so trying as Miss Wickham.
I’m sure Mrs. Hubbard has been kindness itself to me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Considering.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what you mean by considering.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Considering that she’s rich and you’re poor. She gives you her old
clothes. She often doesn’t ask you to have dinner by yourself when she’s
giving a party. She doesn’t remind you that you’re dependent unless
she’s very much put out. But you&mdash;you’ve had<a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a> thirty years of it. You’ve

you know. [<i>He turns to</i> <i>Miss Pringle</i>.] Benjamin and Sarah, you know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>I understand perfectly, but it wasn’t Sarah.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>Wasn’t it? When one of her old friends dies, mother goes to the funeral
and says to herself: “Well, I’ve seen her out, anyhow.” Then she comes
back and eats muffins for tea. She always eats muffins after she’s been
to a funeral.</p>

Benjamin’s mother, whose mother was she?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>If you want to know, I recommend you to read your Bible.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With much satisfaction.</i>] I thought it was a stumper. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Norah</span>.]
The fact is, I’m going to Canada, and mother told me you’d got a brother
or something out there.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>A brother, not a something.<a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>And she said, perhaps you wouldn’t mind giving me a letter to him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I will with pleasure. But I’m afraid he won’t be much use to you. He’s a
farmer and he lives miles away from anywhere.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>But I’m going in for farming.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Are you? What on earth for?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>I’ve jolly well got to do something, and I think farming’s about the
best thing I can do. One gets a lot of shooting and riding, you know.
And then there are tennis parties and dances. And you make a pot of
money, there’s no doubt about that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I thought you were in some motor business in London.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>Well, I was in a way. But ... I thought you’d have heard about it.
Mother’s been telling everybody. Governor won’t speak to me. Altogether
things are rotten. I want to get out of this beastly country as quick as
I can.</p>

<p>Fact is, I’m broke. I was all right as long as I stuck to bridge. I used
to make money on that. Over a thousand a year.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Miss Pringle.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Horrified.</i>] What!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning round.</i>] With what?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p><i>Chemin de fer.</i> Never heard of it? I got in the habit of going to
Thornton’s. I suppose you never heard of him either. He keeps a gambling
hell. Gives you a slap-up supper for nothing, as much pop as you can
drink, and changes your cheques like a bird. The result is I’ve lost
every bob I had, and then Thornton sued me on a cheque I’d given him.
The Governor forked out, but he says I’ve got to go to Canada. I’m never
going to gamble again, I can tell you that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh, well, that’s something.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>You can’t make money at <i>chemi</i>. The <i>cagnotte’s</i> bound to clear you out
in the end. When I come<a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a> back I’m going to stick to bridge. There are
always plenty of mugs about, and if you’ve got a good head for cards you
can’t help making an income out of it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Here is your letter.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>Thanks awfully. I daresay I shan’t want it, you know. I expect I shall
get offered a job the moment I land, but there’s no harm having it. I’ll
be getting along.</p>

walls in cheap gilt frames are coloured supplements from the
Christmas numbers of illustrated papers. Over one door is the head

covered with shiny oil-cloth. In the window are geraniums growing
in maple-syrup tins. On one side is a large American stove. There
is a dresser of unvarnished deal on which are plates and cups and
saucers. They are of the plainest earthenware, and few of them
match. There are two American rockers and a number of kitchen
chairs. There is a plain kitchen table. On the stove is an enormous
kettle and a couple of saucepans. There is a small bookshelf on
which are a few tattered novels and some old magazines. The table
is set for dinner with a cheap white cloth, none too clean.</i> <span class="smcap">Ed
Marsh</span> <i>is sitting at one end, with the remains of a joint of cold
beef in front of him, and at the other end is his wife, with a

other people around were Indians. The first two years they was there
they wouldn’t have anything to do with the Indians because they was so
dirty, and after that the Indians wouldn’t have anything to do with
them. [<i>He puts his fingers to his nose to indicate a nasty smell.</i>]</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What a disgusting story!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>D’you think so? I rather like it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You would.</p>

<p>[<i>Getting up.</i>] Are you going to sit there all day, Norah?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Why don’t you keep quiet for five minutes? I guess Norah’s not sorry to
have a rest after that wash.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>The amount of work Norah did isn’t going to tire her much, I reckon.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I’m not used to that sort of work yet. It takes it out of me a bit.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>I’ve not found out what sort of work you are used to.</p>

<p>Give her time to get used to the life, Gertie. You can’t expect
everything all at once.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>It’s always the same with English people. You have to teach them
everything.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Well, you didn’t have to teach me to propose, Gertie.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I can’t honestly say that it makes the least difference to me whether
you go or stay.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Now don’t start quarrelling, you two.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>When does your train go, Frank?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Half-past three. I’ll be starting from here in about an hour.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Reg can go over with you and he’ll drive the rig back again.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>All right. I’ll go and dress myself in a bit.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>I guess you’ll be glad to get back to your own place.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>I’ve noticed the things aren’t half clean when I leave them to you to
do.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I’m sorry. Why didn’t you tell me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>I suppose <i>you</i> never did the washing up in England. Too grand?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I don’t suppose anyone would wash up if they could help it. It’s not
very amusing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>You always want to be amused.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>No. But I want to be happy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>Well, you’ve got a room over your head and a comfortable bed to sleep
in, three good meals a day, and plenty to do; that’s all anybody wants
to make them happy, I guess.<a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>Oh, lord!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning sharply on him.</i>] Well, if you don’t like Canada, why did you
come out?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising slowly to his feet.</i>] You don’t suppose I’d have let them send
me if I’d known what I was in for? Not much. Up at five in the morning
and working in the fields like a navvy till your back feels as if it ’ud
break, and then back again in the afternoon. And the same thing day
after day. What was the good of sending me to Harrow and Oxford if
that’s what I’ve got to do all my life?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>You’ll get used to it soon enough, Reg. It’s a bit hard at first, but
when you get your foot in you wouldn’t change it for any other life.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>This isn’t a country for a man to go to sleep with and wait for
something to turn up.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Trotter.</span></p>

<p>I wouldn’t go back to England now, not for nothing. England! Eighteen
bob a week, that’s what I earned, and no prospects. Out of work five
months in the year.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What did you do in England?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Trotter.</span></p>

<p>Bricklayer, Miss.<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>You needn’t call her miss. Norah’s her name. You call me Gertie, don’t
you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Trotter.</span></p>

<p>What with strikes an’ bad times you never knew where you was. And the
foreman bullying you. I don’t know what all. I ’ad about enough of it, I
can tell you. I’ve never been out of work since the day I landed. I’ve
had as much to eat as I wanted and I’m saving money. In this country
everybody’s as good as everybody else.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>If not better.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Trotter.</span></p>

<p>In two years I shall be able to set up for myself. Why, there’s old man
Thompson, up at Pratt, he started as a bricklayer, come from Yorkshire,
he did. He’s got seven thousand dollars in the bank now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>You fellows who come out now have a much softer thing on than I did when
I first came. In those days they wouldn’t have an Englishman, they’d
have a Galician rather. In Winnipeg, when they advertised in the paper
for labour, you’d see often as not no English need apply.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>Well, it was their own fault. They wouldn’t work or anything. They just
soaked.<a name="page_047" id="page_047"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>It was their own fault right enough. This was the dumping ground for all
the idlers, drunkards, and scallywags in England. They had the delusion
over there that if a man was too big a rotter to do anything at all in
England he’d only got to be sent out here and he’d make a fortune.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess things ain’t as bad as that now. They send us a different class.
It takes an Englishman two years longer than anybody else to get the
hang of things, but when once he tumbles to it he’s better than any of
them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>I guess nowadays everyone’s glad to see the Englishman make good. When I
nearly smashed up three years ago, I had no end of offers to help.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>How did you smash up?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I had a run of bad luck. One year my crop was frosted and then next
year I was hailed out. It wants a good deal of capital to stand up
against that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>That’s what happened to me. I was hailed out, and I hadn’t got capital,
so I just had to hire out. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Norah</span>.] If it hadn’t been for that
hailstorm you wouldn’t have had the pleasure of making my acquaintance.<a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ironically.</i>] How hollow and empty life would have been without that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>I wonder you didn’t just quit and start out Calgary way.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Well, I’d put in two years on my homestead and done a lot of clearing.
It seemed kind of silly to lose my rights now. And when you’ve been
hailed out once the chances are it won’t happen again, for some years
that is, and by that time I ought to have put a bit by.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What sort of a house have you got?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Well, it ain’t what you might call a palace, but it’s large enough for
two.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Thinking of marrying?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Well, I guess it’s kind of lonesome on a farm without a woman. But it’s
not so easy to find a wife when you’re just starting on your own.
Canadian girls think twice before taking a farmer.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>They know something, I guess.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Well, you took one, Gertie.<a name="page_049" id="page_049"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>Not because I wanted to, you can be sure of that. I don’t know how you
got round me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>I wonder.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>I guess it was because you was kind of helpless, and I didn’t know what
you’d do without me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>I guess it was love and you couldn’t help yourself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I’m thinking of going to one of them employment agencies when I get to
Winnipeg and looking the girls over.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Like sheep.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know anythin’ about sheep. I’ve never had to do with sheep.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>And d’you think you know anything about women?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess I can tell if they’re strong and willing. And so long as they
ain’t cock-eyed I don’t mind taking the rest on trust.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>And what inducement is there for a girl to have you?<a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Trotter.</span></p>

<p>That’s why he wants to catch ’em young, when they’ve just landed and
don’t know much.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I’ve got my quarter section&mdash;a hundred and sixty acres, with seventy of
it cleared&mdash;and I’ve got a shack that I built myself. That’s something,
ain’t it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You’ve got a home to offer and enough to eat and drink. A girl can get
that anywhere. Why, they’re simply begging for service.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Some girls like getting married. There’s something in the word that
appeals to them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You seem to think a girl would jump at the chance of marrying you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>She might do worse.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I think you flatter yourself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I know my job and there ain’t too many as can say that. I’ve got brains.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What makes you think so?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Well, I can see you’re no fool.<a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] He put one over on you then, Norah.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Good-humouredly.</i>] Because you’ve got no use for me, there’s no saying
but what others may have.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Gertie</span> <i>takes the basin out in order to pour away the water</i>.

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Of course, there’s no accounting for tastes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I can try, can’t I?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>It’s very wise of you to go to an agency. A girl’s more likely to marry
you when she’s only seen you once than when she’s seen you often.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a wink at the others.</i>] It seems to make you quite mad, the
thought of me marrying.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You wouldn’t talk about it like that unless you looked down upon women.
Oh, I pity the poor wretched creature who becomes your wife.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess she won’t have a bad time when I’ve broken her in to my ways.<a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Are you under the impression you can do that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Yep.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You’re not expecting that there’ll be much love lost between you and the
girl you&mdash;honour with your choice?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>What’s love got to do with it? It’s a business proposition.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I give her board and lodging and the charm of my society. And in return
she’s got to cook and bake and wash and keep the shack clean and tidy.
And if she can do that I’ll not be particular what she looks like.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>So long as she’s not cock-eyed.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>No, I draw the line at that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ironically.</i>] I beg your pardon. I didn’t know it was a general
servant you wanted. You spend a dollar and a half on a marriage licence,
and then you don’t have to pay any wages. It’s a good investment.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>You’ve got a sharp tongue in your head for a girl, Norah.<a name="page_053" id="page_053"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Please don’t call me Norah.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be so silly. It’s the custom of the country. Why, they all call me
Ed.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I don’t care what the custom of the country is. I’m not going to be
called Norah by the hired man.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Don’t you bother, Ed. I’ll call her Miss Marsh if she likes it better.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I should like to see you married to someone who’d give you what you
deserved. I’d like to see your pride humbled. You think yourself very
high and mighty, don’t you? I’d like to see a woman take you by the
heart-strings and wring them till you screamed with pain.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>I understand you didn’t till you were forced to.</p>

<p>Your brother behaved like a perfect brick. I sent him on your letter and
told him I was up against it&mdash;d’you know I hadn’t got a bob? I was jolly

<p>[<i>Laughing.</i>] I can see you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>Your brother sent me my fare to come here and told me I could do the
chores. I didn’t know what they were. I found out it was doing all the
jobs that it wasn’t anybody else’s job to do. And they call it God’s own
country.</p>

<p>[<i>With a flash of spirit.</i>] And acknowledge myself beaten? [<i>There is a

tried to get another position as lady’s companion. I answered
advertisements. I hung about the agent’s offices.... Two people offered
to take me without a salary. One woman suggested ten shillings a week
and my lunch. She expected me to find myself a room, clothes, breakfast
and supper on ten shillings a week. That settled me. I wrote to Eddie
and said I was coming. When I’d paid my fare I had eight pounds in the<a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a>
world. That’s the result of ten years’ work as lady’s companion. When he
came to meet me at the station at Dyer....</p>

<p>Don’t call it a station, call it a depôt.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>I can’t make out what people are up to in the Old Country. They think
that if a man is too big a rotter to do anything at all in England
they’ve only got to send him out here and he’ll make a fortune.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a look at</i> <span class="smcap">Norah</span>.] You’ve thoroughly upset Gertie.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>She’s very easily upset, isn’t she?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>It’s only since you came that things haven’t gone right. We never used
to have scenes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Do you blame me? I came prepared to like her and help her. She met all
my advances with suspicion.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>She thinks you look down upon her. You ought to remember that she never
had your opportunities. She’s earned her own living from the time she
was thirteen. You can’t expect in her the refinements of a woman who’s
led the protected life that you have.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I haven’t said a word that could be turned into the least suggestion of
disapproval of anything she did.<a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>My dear, your whole manner has expressed disapproval. You won’t do
things in the way we do them. After all, the way you lived in Tunbridge
Wells isn’t the only way people can live. Our ways suit us, and when you
live amongst us you must adopt them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>She never gave me a chance to learn them. She treated me with suspicion
and enmity from the very first day I came here. When she sneered at me
because I talked of a station instead of a depôt, of course I went on
talking of a station. Because I prefer to drink water with my meals
instead of strong tea she said I was putting on side.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Why can’t you humour her? You see, you’ve got to take the blame for all
the English people who came here in the past and were lazy, worthless,
and supercilious. They called us Colonials and turned up their noses at
us. What d’you expect us to do? Say, “Thank you very much, sir; we know
we’re not worthy to black your boots; and don’t bother to work&mdash;it’ll be
a pleasure for us to give you money”? It’s no good blinking the fact,
there was a great prejudice against the English, but it’s giving way
now, and every sensible man and woman who comes out can do something to
destroy it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a shrug of the shoulders.</i>] If you’re tired of having me here I
can go back to Winnipeg. I shan’t have any difficulty in finding
something to do.<a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Good lord, I don’t want you to go. I like having you here, and it’s
company for Gertie. And you know, jobs aren’t so easy to find as you
think, especially now the winter’s coming on. Everyone wants a job in
the city.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What d’you want me to do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Well, you’ve got to live with Gertie. Why can’t you make the best of
things and meet her half way? You might make allowances for her even if
you think her unreasonable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I’ll have a try.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>I think you ought to apologise for what you said to her just now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I? I’ve got nothing to apologise for. She drove me to distraction.</p>

<p>Does she look upon that as a great hardship?<a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>My dear, we’re twelve miles from the nearest store. We’re thrown upon
one another through the whole of the winter. Last year there was a bad
blizzard, and for six weeks we didn’t see a soul outside the farm.
Unless we learn to put up with one another’s whims life becomes a
perfect hell.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You can go on talking all night, Eddie&mdash;I’ll never apologise. Time after
time when she sneered at me till my blood boiled. I’ve kept my temper.
She deserved ten times more than I said. D’you think I’m going to
knuckle under to a woman like that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Remember she’s my wife, Norah.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Why didn’t you marry a lady?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>What the dickens d’you think is the use of being a lady out here?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You’ve degenerated since you left England.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Now, look here, my dear, I’ll just tell you what Gertie did for me. She
was a waitress in Winnipeg at the Minnedosa Hotel, and she was making
money. She knew what the life was on a farm, much harder than anything
she’d been used to in the city, but she accepted all the hardship of it,
and the monotony&mdash;because she loved me.<a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>She thought it a good match. You were a gentleman.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Fiddledidee. She had the chance of much better men than me.... And when
I lost my harvest two years running, d’you know what she did? She went
back to the hotel in Winnipeg for the winter so as to carry things on
till the next harvest. And at the end of the winter she gave me every
cent she’d earned to pay the interest of my mortgage and the instalments
on the machinery.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>There is a pause.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Very well, I’ll apologise. But leave me alone with her. I&mdash;I don’t think
I could do it before anyone else.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>All right. I’ll go and tell her.</p>

<p>That’s what I’m going to leave you alone for.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

to apologise it’s got to be private. No, thank you.</p>

<p>For peace and quietness.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be rough on her, Gertie. No one likes apologising.</p>

<p>People who don’t like apologising should keep a better lookout on their

<p>Perhaps not, but it’ll do her good.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

anything that hurt you. Please don’t make me humiliate myself before the
others.</p>

<p>I was a stranger and homeless. If you’d had any kindness you wouldn’t

<p>Oh, Gertie, can’t we be friends? Can’t we let bygones be bygones and

him, and he’s the only relation I have in the world. Won’t you let me be
a real sister to you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>It’s rather late to say all that now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>But it’s not too late, is it? I don’t know what I do that irritates you.
I can see how competent you are, and I admire you so much. I know how
splendid you’ve been with Eddie, and how you’ve stuck to him through
thick and thin. You’ve done everything for him.</p>

<p>It seems perfectly hopeless.</p>

him?</p>

you had a grudge against me why did you let me come here?<a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gertie.</span></p>

<p>Ed wanted it, and it was lonely enough sometimes with the men away all
day and no one to talk to. I thought you’d be company for me.... I can’t
bear it when Ed talks to you about the Old Country and people I don’t
know nothing about.</p>

<div class="blockquott"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <span class="smcap">Frank Taylor’s</span> <i>shack at Prentice, Manitoba. It is a low log
cabin, consisting of two rooms. The scene is the living-room. There
is a door at the back towards the left-hand side, and on the right
is another door that leads into the bedroom. A very small low
window at the back. There is a stove on the left, with a long
chimney. On the walls, untidily tacked up, are pictures cut out of
the illustrated papers. Hanging on a nail is a Cariboo coat. On a
shelf beside the stove are the few pots and pans that</i> <span class="smcap">Frank Taylor</span>
<i>possesses. They are battered and much used. There is a broom in
the corner. The furniture consists of a rocking-chair, worn with
use and shabby, a table roughly made by</i> <span class="smcap">Taylor</span> <i>himself from
packing-cases, one kitchen chair and two or three packing-cases
used as stools. On another shelf are maple-syrup tins, in which
groceries are kept. In one corner there is an old suit-case,
locally known as a grip, and a heap of old clothes; in another
corner is a pile of tattered magazines and numbers of the Winnipeg
Free Press. The shack has an untidy, comfortless, bedraggled air.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>When the curtain rises the scene is dark and empty. There is a
faint glimmer of light through the window. The night is bright and

more than a couple of days.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sharp.</span></p>

<p>Well, I’ll be getting back home now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Oh, stay and have a cup of tea, won’t you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sharp.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think I will. It’s getting late and the mare’ll get cold.<a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Put her in the shed.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sharp.</span></p>

<p>No, I think I’ll be toddling. My missus says I was to give you her
compliments, Mrs. Taylor, and she’ll be round to-morrow to see if
there’s anything you want.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>That’s very kind of her. Thank you very much.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Sid lives where you saw that light just about a mile from here, Norah.
Mrs. Sharp’ll be able to help you a lot at first.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sharp.</span></p>

<p>Oh, well, we’ve been here for thirteen years, and we know the way of the
country by now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Norah’s about as green as a new dollar bill, I guess.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sharp.</span></p>

<p>There’s a lot you can’t be expected to know at first. I’ll say
good-night, then, and good luck.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Well, good-night then, Sid, if you won’t stay, and it was real good of
you to come and fetch us in the rig.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sharp.</span></p>

<p>Oh, that’s all right. Good-night to you, Mrs. Taylor.<a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a></p>

<p>Good-night.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Putting the lamp down.</i>] How you startled me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>What d’you think of it?<a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I built it with my own hands. Every one of them logs was a tree I cut
down myself. You wait till the morning and I’ll show you how they’re
joined together at the corners. There’s some neat work there, my girl, I
guess.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Here’s the kettle.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He pours water into it from the pail, and she puts the kettle on

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>You’ll find some tea in one of them tins on the shelf. Leastways there
was some there when I come away. I guess you’re hungry.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think I am, very. I ate a very good supper in the train.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I’m glad you call that a good supper. I guess I could wrap up the amount
you ate in a postal stamp.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I haven’t a very large appetite.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I have. Where’s the loaf we got in Winnipeg this afternoon?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I’ll get it.<a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>And the butter. You’ll bake to-morrow, I reckon.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Yep.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Please.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I haven’t got anything to say at the moment.<a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a></p>

as talks too much.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>What’s that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I was only amusing myself with a reflection.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Taylor</span> <i>takes off his coat and appears in a grey sweater. He sits

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess there’s no place like home. You get a bit fed up with hiring
out. Ed was O.K., I reckon, but it ain’t like being your own boss.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pointing.</i>] What’s through there?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Oh, that’s the bedroom. Like to have a look?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>When I built the shack I fixed it up so as it would do when I got
married. Sid Sharp asked me what in hell I wanted to divide it up in
half for, but I guess women like little luxuries like that.<a name="page_091" id="page_091"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Like what?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Like having a room to sleep in and a room to live in.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Here’s the bread and butter. Will you have some syrup?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He gets up and sits down at the table.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>That water ought to be boiling by now. What about milk?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>That’s one of the things you’ll have to do without till I can afford to
buy a cow.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I can’t drink tea without milk.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>You try. Say, can you milk a cow?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I? No.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Then it’s just as well I ain’t got one.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You’re a philosopher.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Is there a candle? I’ll just get one or two things out of my box.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Ain’t you going to sit down and have a cup of tea?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I don’t want any, thanks.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Sit down, my girl.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Because I tell you to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quite pleasantly.</i>] I don’t think you’d better tell me to do things.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Then I ask you. You ain’t going to refuse the first favour I’ve asked
you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a pretty smile.</i>] Of course not. [<i>She sits down.</i>] There.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Now pour out my tea for me, will you? [<i>He watches her do it.</i>] It is
rum seeing my wife sitting down at my table and pouring out tea for me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Is it pleasant?<a name="page_093" id="page_093"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Sure. Now have some yourself, my girl. You’ll soon get used to drinking
it without milk. And I guess you’ll be able to get some to-morrow from
Mrs. Sharp.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Norah</span> <i>pours herself out some tea</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I had a sort of a feeling I wanted you and me to have the first meal
together in your new home. Just take a bit of the bread and butter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He passes over to her a slice and, smiling, she cuts a little
piece off and eats it.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>We ain’t lost much time, I guess. Why, it’s only yesterday you told me
not to call you Norah.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>That was very silly of me. I was in a temper.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>And now we’re man and wife.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Married in haste with a vengeance.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Ain’t you a bit scared?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I? What of? You?<a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>With Ed on t’other side of Winnipeg, he might just as well be in the Old
Country for all the good he can be to you. You might be a bit scared to
find yourself alone with a man you don’t know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I’m not nervous.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Good for you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You did give me a fright, though. When I asked you if you’d take me, I
suppose it was only about fifteen seconds before you answered, but it
seemed like ten minutes. I thought you might refuse.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I was thinking.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Counting up my good points and setting them against the bad
ones?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>No, I was thinking you wouldn’t have asked me like that if you
hadn’t&mdash;despised me.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Norah</span>, <i>a little taken aback, gives him a quick look, but she

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what makes you think that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Well, I don’t know how you could have put it more plainly that my name
was mud.<a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Why didn’t you refuse, then?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess I’m not a nervous fellow, either.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a twinkle in her eye.</i>] And women are scarce in Manitoba.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I always fancied an Englishwoman. They make the best wives when they’ve
been licked into shape.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Frankly amused.</i>] Are you proposing to attempt that operation on me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>You’re clever. I guess a hint or two is about all you’ll want.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>It embarrasses me when you pay me compliments.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I’ll take you round and show you the land to-morrow. I ain’t done all
the clearing yet, so there’ll be plenty of work for the winter. I want
to have a hundred acres to sow next year. And then if I get a good crop
I’ve a mind to take another quarter. You can’t make it pay really
without you’ve got half a section. And it’s a tough proposition when you
ain’t got capital.<a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I didn’t think I was marrying a millionaire.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Never mind, my girl, you shan’t live in a shack long, I promise you.
It’s the greatest country in the world. We only want three good crops
and you shall have a brick house same as you lived in at home.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I wonder what they’re doing in England now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Well, I guess they’re asleep.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>When I think of England I always think of it at tea-time. [<i>She looks at
the tea-things they have just used.</i>] Miss Wickham had a beautiful old
silver teapot&mdash;George II.&mdash;and she was awfully proud of it. And she was
very proud of her tea-set&mdash;it was old Worcester&mdash;and she wouldn’t let
anyone wash the things but.... And two or three times a week an old
Indian judge came in to tea, and he used to talk to me about the
East&mdash;oh, why did you make me think of it all?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>The past is dead and gone, my girl. We’ve got the future.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Paying no attention to his words.</i>] One never knows when one’s well
off, does one? It’s madness to think of what’s gone for ever.<a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I wish we’d got a drop of liquor here so as we could drink one another’s
health. But as we ain’t you’d better give me a kiss instead.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Lightly.</i>] I’m not very fond of kissing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] It ain’t generally an acquired taste, but I guess
you’re peculiar.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>It looks like it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Come, my girl, you didn’t even kiss me after we was married.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a perfectly friendly way.</i>] Isn’t a hint enough for you? Why do you
force me to say everything in so many words?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>It seems to me it wants a few words to make it plain when a woman
refuses to give her husband a kiss.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Do sit down, there’s a good fellow, and I’ll tell you one or two things.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>That’s terribly kind of you. [<i>He sinks back into the rocking-chair.</i>]
Have you any choice of seats?<a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You’ve taken the only one that’s tolerably comfortable. I think there’s
nothing to choose between the others.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I think we’d better fix things up before we go any further.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You gave me to understand very plainly that you wanted a wife in order
to get a general servant without having to pay her wages. Wages are high
in Canada.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>That was the way you put it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Baching isn’t very comfortable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Not very.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You wanted someone to cook and bake for you, wash, sweep, and mend. I
offered to come and do all that. It never struck me for an instant that
there was any possibility of your expecting anything else of me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Then you’re a damned fool, my girl.<a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Firing up.</i>] D’you mind not saying things like that to me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Good-humouredly.</i>] I guess I shall have to say a good many things like
that before we’ve done.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I asked you to marry me only because I couldn’t stay in the shack
without.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess you asked me to marry you because you was in a hell of a temper.
You wanted to get away from Ed’s farm right then, and you didn’t care
what you did so long as you quit. But you was darned sorry for what
you’d done by the time you’d packed your box.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Frigidly.</i>] What makes you think that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Why, when you come back in the kitchen you was as white as a sheet. You
wanted to say you’d changed your mind, but your darned pride wouldn’t
let you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I wouldn’t have stayed on in that house for anything in the world.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>And this morning, when I called for you at the Y.W.C.A., you wanted to
say you wouldn’t marry me. You tried to speak the words, but they
wouldn’t<a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a> come. When you shook hands with me your hand was like ice.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I was nervous for a moment. After all, one isn’t married every day of
one’s life, is one?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>If I hadn’t shown you the licence and the ring, I guess you wouldn’t
have done it. You hadn’t the nerve to back out of it then.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I hadn’t slept a wink all night. I kept on turning it over in my mind. I
was frightened at what I’d done. But I didn’t know a soul in Winnipeg. I
hadn’t anywhere to go. I had four dollars in my pocket. I had to go
through with it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>You took pretty good stock of me in the train on the way here, I guess.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Recovering herself.</i>] What makes you think so?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Well, I felt you was looking at me a good deal. It wasn’t hard to see
that you was turning me over in your mind. What conclusion did you come
to?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You see, I lived all those years with an old lady. I know very little
about men.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guessed that.<a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I came to the conclusion that you were a decent fellow. I thought you
would be kind to me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Bouquets are just flying around. Have you got anything more to say to
me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Then just get me my pouch, will you? I guess it’s in the pocket of my
coat.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She hesitates a moment, looks at him, then gets it.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Here you are.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With his tongue in his cheek.</i>] I thought you was going to tell me I
could darned well get it myself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I don’t very much like being ordered about.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>You never paid much attention to me till to-day, I reckon.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I was always polite to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Very. But I was the hired man, and you never let me forget it. You
thought yourself a darned sight better than me because you could play
the piano and speak French. But we ain’t got a piano, and there ain’t
anyone as speaks French nearer than Winnipeg.<a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What are you driving at?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Parlour tricks ain’t much good on the prairie. They’re like dollar bills
up in Hudson Bay. Tobacco’s the only thing you can trade with an
Esquimaux. You can’t cook very well, you don’t know how to milk a
cow&mdash;why, you can’t even harness a horse.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Are you regretting your bargain already?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>No, I guess I can teach you. But if I was you I wouldn’t put on any
frills. We shall get along O.K., I guess, when we’ve shaken down.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You’ll find I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ignoring the remark.</i>] When two people live together in a shack
there’s got to be a deal of give and take on both sides. As long as you
do what I tell you you’ll be all right.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] It’s unfortunate that when anyone tells me to do a
thing I have an irresistible desire not to do it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess I tumbled to that. You must get over it.<a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You’ve talked to me once or twice in a way I don’t like. I think we
shall get on better if you <i>ask</i> me to do things.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Don’t forget that I can <i>make</i> you do them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Well, I’m stronger than you are.</p>

<p>I guess you won’t have much cause to complain.</p>

<p>All the life was so strange to me. In England they think it’s so
different from what it really is. I thought I should have a horse to
ride. I expected dances and tennis parties. And when I came out I was so
out of it. I felt in the way. And yesterday they drove me frantic so
that I felt I couldn’t stay another moment in that house. It was only an
impulse. I made a mistake. I didn’t know what I was doing. You can’t
have the heart to take advantage of it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>See here, my girl&mdash;you was educated like a lady and spent your life
doing nothing&mdash;a lady’s companion, wasn’t you&mdash;taking a little dawg out
for a walk of a morning and combing out his pretty little coat? And you
look upon yourself as a darned sight better than me. I never had no
schooling, and it’s a hell of a job for me to write a letter, but since
I was so high I’ve earned my living. I guess I’ve been all over this
country. I’ve been a trapper and I’ve worked on the railroad, and for
two years I’ve been a freighter. I guess I’ve done pretty near
everything but serve in a store. Now you just get busy and forget all
the nonsense you’ve got in your head. You’re nothing but an ignorant
woman and I’m your master. I’m going to do what I like with you, and if
you don’t submit willingly, by God I’ll take you as the trappers in the
old days used to take the squaws.</p>

<p>[<i>Aghast.</i>] It wasn’t loaded.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Of course it wasn’t loaded. D’you think I’d have stood there and told
you to shoot if it had been? I guess I ain’t thinking of committing
suicide.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>And I almost admired you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>You hadn’t got no reason to. There’s nothing to admire about a man who
stands five feet off a loaded gun that’s being aimed at him. He’s a

want you. [<i>She gives him a sidelong look of terror, but still does not

Prentice, but there are signs about it of a woman’s presence. There
is a cloth on the table, and a cushion on the rocking-chair, there
are muslin curtains on the window tied back with ribband, and there
are geraniums growing in maple-syrup tins. There is a rough
bookshelf against the wall, on which is</i> <span class="smcap">Norah’s</span> <i>small stock of
books. Coloured supplements from the Christmas numbers of
illustrated papers are pinned neatly on the walls. The

winter. When the door of the shack is opened the blue sky is seen
and the prairie.</i> <span class="smcap">Norah</span> <i>is arranging mustard flowers in a pudding
basin on the table. She wears a serge skirt and a neat shirt-waist:
she has a healthier look than before, her face is tanned and she

<i>enters</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I didn’t know you were about.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I ain’t got much to do to-day. I’ve been out with Sid Sharp and a man
come over from Prentice.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Noticing the flowers.</i>] Say, what have you got there?<a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Aren’t they pretty? I picked them just now. They’re so cheerful.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Drily.</i>] Very.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>A few flowers make the shack look so much more bright and cosy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking round him.</i>] You’ve made it a real home, Norah. Mrs. Sharp
never stops wondering how you done it. Sid was saying only the other day
it was because you was a lady. It does make a difference, I guess.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little smile.</i>] I’m glad you haven’t found me quite a hopeless
failure.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess I’ve never been so comfortable in all my life. It’s what I
always said&mdash;when English girls do take to the life they make a better
job of it than anybody.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What’s the man come out from Prentice for?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After a moment’s pause.</i>] I guess you ain’t been terribly happy here,
my girl.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What on earth makes you say that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>You’ve got a good memory, I guess, and you ain’t ever forgiven me for
that first night.<a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking down.</i>] I made up my mind very soon that I must accept the
consequences of what I’d done. I tried to fall in with your ways.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>You was clever enough to see that I meant to be master in my own house,
and I had the strength to do it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a faint smile.</i>] I’ve cooked for you and mended your clothes, and
I’ve kept the shack clean. I’ve been obedient and obliging.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little chuckle.</i>] I guess you hated me sometimes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>No one likes being humiliated as you humiliated me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Ed’s coming out here presently, my girl.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Ed who?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Your brother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Astounded.</i>] Eddie? When?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Why, right now, I guess. He was in Prentice this morning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>How d’you know?<a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>He phoned over to Sharp’s to say he was riding out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh, how ripping! Why didn’t you tell me before?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I didn’t know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Is that why you asked me if I was happy? I couldn’t make out what was
the matter with you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Well, I guess I thought if you still wanted to quit, Ed’s coming would
be kind of useful.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Why d’you think I want to?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>You ain’t been very talkative these months, but I guess it wasn’t hard
to see you’d have given pretty near anything in the world to quit.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I’m not going back to Eddie’s farm, if that’s what you mean.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>If he comes before I get back, tell him I won’t be long. I guess you
won’t be sorry to do a bit of yarning with him by yourself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You’re not under the impression I’m going to say beastly things about
you to him?<a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>No, I guess not. That ain’t your sort. P’raps we don’t know the best of
one another yet, but I reckon we know the worst by now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at him sharply.</i>] Frank, is anything the matter?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Why, no. Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You’ve seemed different the last few days.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>He can put the horse in the lean-to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Yes. [<i>Calling.</i>] Reg, give the old lady a feed and put her in the
lean-to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>Right-o.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Didn’t you see Frank? He’s only just this moment gone out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>He’ll be in presently. Now, come in. Oh, my dear, it is splendid to see
you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>You’re looking fine, Norah.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Have you had dinner?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Sure. We got something to eat before we left Prentice.<a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Well, I’ll make you a cup of tea.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>No, I won’t have anything, thanks.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You’re not a real Canadian yet if you refuse a cup of tea when it’s
offered you. Well, sit down and make yourself comfortable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>How are you getting on, Norah?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh, never mind about me. Tell me about yourself. How’s Gertie? And what
brought you to this part of the world? And what’s Reggie Hornby doing?
And is thingamygig still with you? You know, the hired man. What was his
name? Trotter, wasn’t it? Oh, my dear, don’t sit there like a stuffed
pig, but speak to me, or I shall shake you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>My dear, I can’t answer fifteen questions all at once.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Eddie, I’m so glad to see you. You are a duck to come and see me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Let me get a word in edgeways.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I won’t say another syllable. But for goodness’ sake, hurry up. I want
to know all sorts of things.<a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Well, the first thing is that I’m expecting to be a happy father in
three or four months.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Eddie, I’m so glad. How happy Gertie must be!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>She doesn’t know what to make of it. But I guess she’s pleased right
enough. She sends you her love and says she hopes you’ll follow her
example soon.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I? But you’ve not told me what you’re doing in this part of the world,
anyway.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Anyway?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a laugh.</i>] I’ve practically spoken to no one but Frank for
months. I get into his ways of speaking.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Well, when I got Frank’s letter about the clearing machine....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting him.</i>] Has Frank written to you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Why, yes. Didn’t you know? He said there was a clearing machine going
cheap at Prentice. I’ve always thought I could make money down our way
if I had one. They say you can clear from three to<a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a> four acres a day
with it. Frank said it was worth my while coming to have a look at it,
and he guessed you’d be glad to see me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>How funny of him not to say anything to me about it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>I expect he wanted to surprise you. Now, how d’you like being a married
woman?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh, all right. Why has Reggie Hornby come with you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>D’you know, I’ve not seen you since you were married.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You haven’t, have you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>I’ve been a bit anxious about you. That’s why, when Frank wrote about
the clearing machine, I didn’t stop to think about it, but just came.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>It was very nice of you. But why has Reggie Hornby come?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Oh, he’s going back to England.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Is he?<a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Yes, he got them to send him his passage at last. His ship doesn’t sail
till next week, and he said he might just as well stop off here and say
good-bye to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>How has he been getting on?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>What do you expect? He looks upon work as something that only damned
fools do. Where’s Frank?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh, he’s out with Sid Sharp. That’s our neighbour. He has the farm you
passed on your way here.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Getting on all right with him, Norah?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Of course. What’s that boy doing all this time? He <i>is</i> slow, isn’t he?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>It’s a great change for you, this, after the sort of life you’ve been
used to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To change the topic.</i>] I was rather hoping you’d have some letters for
me. I haven’t had any for a long time.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>There now, I’ve got a head like a sieve. Two came by the last mail and I
didn’t send them on because I was coming myself.<a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You haven’t forgotten them?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>No, here they are.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Reading the addresses.</i>] They don’t look very exciting. One’s from
Agnes Pringle. She was a lady’s companion that I used to know in
Tunbridge Wells. And the other’s from Mr. Wynne.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Who’s he?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh, he was Miss Wickham’s solicitor. He wrote to me once before to say
he hoped I was getting on all right. [<i>Putting the letters on the
table.</i>] I don’t think I want to hear from people in England any more.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>My dear, why d’you say that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>It’s no good thinking of the past, is it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Aren’t you going to read your letters?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Not now. I’ll read them when I’m alone.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Don’t mind me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>It’s so silly of me, but letters from England always make me cry.<a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at her sharply.</i>] Norah, aren’t you happy here?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Yes, why shouldn’t I be?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Why haven’t you written to me once since you were married?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I hadn’t got much to say. [<i>With a smile.</i>] And after all, I’d been
practically turned out of your house.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Puzzled.</i>] I don’t know what to make of you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Nervous and almost exasperated.</i>] Oh, don’t cross-examine me, there’s
a dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Frank Taylor’s kind to you and all that sort of thing, isn’t he?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Quite.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>When I asked you to come and stay on the farm I thought it wouldn’t be
long before you married, but I didn’t expect you’d marry one of the
hired men.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear, don’t worry about me.<a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>It’s all very fine to say that. You’ve got no one in the world belonging
to you but me, and when&mdash;when our mother died, she said: “You’ll take
care of Norah, won’t you, Eddie?”</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a sob in her voice.</i>] Oh, don’t, don’t.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Norah.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With an effort at self-possession.</i>] We’ve never quarrelled since the
first day I came here. Here’s Reggie.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She turns to him with relief.</i> <span class="smcap">Hornby</span> <i>is dressed in a blue serge

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gaily.</i>] I was wondering what on earth you were doing with yourself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking hands with her.</i>] I say, this is a very swell shack you’ve
got.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I’ve tried to make it look pretty and homelike.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Marsh</span> <i>catches sight of the bowl of mustard flowers</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Hulloa, what’s this?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Aren’t they pretty? I’ve only just picked them. Mustard flowers.<a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>We call it weed. Have you got much of it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh yes, lots. Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Oh, nothing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Hornby</span>.] I hear you’re going home.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I’m fed up with God’s own country. Nature never intended me to be
an agricultural labourer.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What are you going to do now?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With immense conviction.</i>] Loaf!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Amused.</i>] Won’t you get bored?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>I’m never bored. It amuses me to look at other people do things. I
should hate my fellow creatures to be idle.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a faint smile.</i>] I should have thought one could do more with
life than lounge about clubs and play cards with people who don’t play
as well as oneself.<a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>I quite agree with you. I’ve been thinking things over very seriously
this winter. And I’m going to look out for a middle-aged widow with
money who’ll adopt me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I remember that you have decided views about the White Man’s Burden.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>All I want is to get through life comfortably. I don’t mean to do a
stroke more work than I’m obliged to, and I’m going to have the very
best time I can get.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I’m sure you will.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>The moment I get back to London I’m going to stand myself a slap-up
dinner at the Ritz, then I shall go and see a musical comedy at the
Gaiety, and after that I’ll have a slap-up supper at Romano’s. England,
with all thy faults, I love thee well.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I suppose it’s being alone with the prairie all these months, things
which used to seem rather funny and clever&mdash;well, I see them quite
differently now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coolly.</i>] I’m afraid you don’t altogether approve of me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Not disagreeably.</i>] You haven’t got pluck.<a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know about that. I expect I have as much as anyone else, only I
don’t make a fuss about it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh, pluck to stand up and let yourself be shot at&mdash;I daresay. But pluck
to do the same monotonous thing day after day, plain, honest, hard
work&mdash;you haven’t got that. You’re a failure, and the worst of it is,
you’re not ashamed of it. It fills you with self-satisfaction.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>Rule Britannia, and what price the Union Jack?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a laugh.</i>] You’re incorrigible.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>I am.... I suppose there’s nothing you want me to take home. I shall be
going down to Tunbridge Wells to see mother. Got any messages?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know that I have. Eddie has just brought me a couple of letters.
I’ll have a look at them. [<i>She opens Miss Pringle’s letter, reads two
or three lines, and gives a cry.</i>] Oh!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>What’s the matter?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What does she mean? [<i>Reading.</i>] “I’ve just heard from Mr. Wynne about
your good luck, and I have another piece of good news for you.” [<i>She
puts<a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a> the letter down and quickly opens the solicitor’s. She takes out
of the envelope a letter and a cheque. She glances at it.</i>] A
cheque&mdash;for five hundred pounds.... Oh, Eddie, listen. [<i>Reading.</i>]
“Dear Miss Marsh,&mdash;I have had several interviews with Mr. Wickham in
relation to the late Miss Wickham’s estate, and I ventured to represent
to him that you had been very badly treated. Now that everything is
settled he wishes to send you the enclosed cheque as some recognition of
your devoted service to his late aunt....” Five hundred pounds!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>That’s a very respectable sum.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>I could do with that myself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I’ve never had so much money in all my life.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>But what’s the other piece of good news that Miss Stick-in-the-mud talks
about?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I forgot. [<i>She takes Miss Pringle’s letter up again and begins to
read it.</i>] “...Piece of good news for you. I write at once so that you
may make your plans accordingly. I told you in my last letter of my
sister-in-law’s sudden death, and now my brother is very anxious that I
should live with him. So I am leaving Mrs. Hubbard, and she wishes me to
say that if you care to have my place as her companion<a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a> she will be very
pleased to have you. I have been with her for thirteen years, and she
has always treated me like an equal. She is very considerate, and there
is practically nothing to do but to exercise the dogs. The salary is
thirty-five pounds a year.”</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Both letters are addressed to Miss Marsh. Don’t they know you’re
married?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>No. I never told them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>What a lark! You could go back to Tunbridge Wells, and none of the old
frumps would ever know you’d been married.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Norah</span> <i>gives a sudden start when he says this and stares at him

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Just clear out for a minute, Reg. I want to speak to Norah.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>Right-o.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He goes out.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Norah, d’you want to clear out?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What on earth makes you think that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>You gave him such a look when he mentioned it.<a name="page_138" id="page_138"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I’m bewildered. Did Frank know anything about this?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>My dear, how could he?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>It’s so extraordinary. He was talking about my going away just now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quickly.</i>] Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She realises that she has betrayed the secret inadvertently.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Norah, for goodness’ sake tell me if there’s anything the matter. After
all, it’s now or never. You’re keeping back something from me. Aren’t
you getting on well together?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a low voice.</i>] Not very.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Why didn’t you let me know?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I was ashamed.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>But you say he’s kind to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I’ve got nothing to reproach him with.<a name="page_139" id="page_139"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>I felt that something was wrong. I knew you couldn’t be happy with him.
A girl like you and a hired man. The whole thing was horrible. Thank God
I’m here and you’ve got this chance.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What d’you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>You’re not fit for this life. You’ve got a chance to go back to England.
For God’s sake take it. In six months all you’ve gone through here will
seem nothing but a hideous dream. [<i>He is suddenly struck by the
expression of her face.</i>] Norah, what’s the matter?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Tragically.</i>] I don’t know.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Hornby</span> <i>comes in again</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>I say, here’s someone coming to see you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Me? [<i>She goes to the door and looks out.</i>] Oh, it’s Mrs. Sharp.
Whatever brings her here on foot? She never walks a step if she can help
it. She’s the wife of my neighbour.... Good-afternoon, Mrs. Sharp.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp</span> <i>enters. She is a middle-aged woman, red in the face,

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Come right in.<a name="page_140" id="page_140"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>Good-afternoon to you, Mrs. Taylor. I’m all in a perspiration. I’ve not
walked so far in months.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>This is my brother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>Your brother? Is that who it is?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] It seems to surprise you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>I was so anxious, I couldn’t stay indoors. I went out to see if I could
catch sight of Sid, and I walked on and then I saw the rig what’s
outside, and it give me such a turn, I thought it was the inspector. I
just had to come. I was that nervous.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Is anything the matter?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>You’re not going to tell me you don’t know about it? Why, Sid and Frank
haven’t been talking about anything else since Frank found it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Found what?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>The weed.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a slight gesture towards the pudding bowl of flowers.</i>] You have
got it, then?<a name="page_141" id="page_141"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>It’s worse at Taylor’s. But we’ve got it too.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>What does it mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>We can’t make out who reported us. It isn’t as if we had any enemies.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Oh, there’s always someone to report you. No one’s going to take the
risk of letting it get on his own land.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at the mustard blossom.</i>] And she has them in the house as if
they were flowers.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Tell me what she means, Eddie.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>My dear, these pretty little flowers which you’ve picked to make your
shack look bright and homelike&mdash;they may mean ruin.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Eddie!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>You must have heard us talk about the weed. We farmers have three
enemies to fight&mdash;frost, hail, and weed.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>We was hailed out last year. Lost our crop. We never got a dollar for
it. And if we lose it this year too&mdash;why, we may just as well quit.<a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>When it gets into your crop you’ve got to report it, and if you don’t
one of the neighbours will. And then they send an inspector along, and
if he condemns it, why you just have to destroy the crop, and all your
year’s work is lost. You’re lucky if you’ve got a bit of money in the
bank and can go on till the next crop comes along.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>We’ve only got a quarter section and five children. It’s not much money
you can save then.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>Are they out with the inspector now?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>Yes. He came out from Prentice this morning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>This is a bad job for Frank.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>Oh, he hasn’t got the mouths to feed that we have. He can hire out
again. But what’s to become of us?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I wonder why he never told me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>I guess he’s in the habit of keeping his troubles to himself and you’ve
not taught him different yet.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Norah</span> <i>gives her a quick look, but seeing the woman is all on edge

<p><a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>You must hope for the best, Mrs. Sharp.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>Sid says we’ve only got it in one place, but perhaps he’s only saying it
so I shouldn’t worry. You know what them inspectors are. They don’t lose
nothing by it. It don’t matter to them if you starve all the winter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She gives a sob and heavy tears roll down her cheeks.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh don’t&mdash;don’t cry, Mrs. Sharp. After all, it may be all right.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>They won’t condemn the crop unless it’s very bad. Too many people have
got their eyes on it. The machine agent, the loan company.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>What with the hail that comes and hails you out and the frost that kills
your crop just when you’re beginning to count on it, and the weed&mdash;I
can’t bear it any more. If we lose this crop I won’t go on. I’ll make
Sid sell out and we’ll go home. We’ll take a little shop somewhere.
That’s what I wanted to do from the beginning, but Sid&mdash;he had his heart
set on farming.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You couldn’t go back now. You’d never be happy in a little shop. And if
you’d stayed in England you’d have been always at the beck and call of
somebody else. And you own the land. You couldn’t<a name="page_144" id="page_144"></a> do that in England.
When you come out of your door and look at the growing wheat, aren’t you
proud to think it’s yours?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>You don’t know what I’ve had to put up with. When the children came,
only once I had a doctor. The other times Sid was the only help I had. I
might have been an animal. I wish I’d never come to this country.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>How can you say that! Your children are strong and healthy. Why, they’ll
be able to help you in the work soon. You’ve given them a chance that
they’d never have got at home.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>Oh, it’s all very well for them. They’ll have it easy. I know that. But
we’ve had to pay for it, Sid and me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You see, you were the first. It’s bitter work opening up a new country
and perhaps it’s others who reap the harvest. But I wonder if those who
start don’t get a reward that the later comers never dream of.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>She’s right there, Mrs. Sharp. I shall never forget what I felt when I
saw my first crop spring up and thought that never since the world began
had wheat grown on that little bit of ground.... I wouldn’t go back to
England now for anything in the world. I couldn’t breathe.<a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>You’re a man. You have the best of it and all the credit.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>People don’t know. You mustn’t blame them. It’s only those who’ve lived
out on the prairie who know that the hardships of opening up a new
country fall on the women. But the men who are their husbands, they
know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Marsh.</span></p>

<p>I guess they do, Mrs. Sharp.</p>

<p>Sid and Frank will be here in a minute, surely.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>And you’re right, my dear, I couldn’t go back any more. If we lose our
crop, well, we must wait till next year. We shan’t starve. One’s got to
take the rough with the smooth, and take it all in all, it’s a good
country.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Hornby.</span></p>

<p>Pleasant surprise for you.</p>

<p>What’s happened? Tell me what’s happened.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Sharp came here because she was so anxious.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Cheerfully.</i>] Oh, you’re all right.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a gasp.</i>] We are?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Sure. Only a few acres has got to go. That won’t hurt you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>Thank God for that. And it’s going to be the best crop we ever had. It’s
the finest country in the world.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>You’d better be getting back. Sid’s taken the inspector up to give him
some dinner.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sharp.</span></p>

<p>Oh, thank you kindly. I’m not used to walking so much and I’m tired out.
Good-afternoon, Mrs. Taylor.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I guess it’s a relief to you now you know, Frank.</p>

<p>Terrible.... I’d like to have a talk with you presently, Ed.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>They’ve got five children to feed. I guess it makes a powerful lot of
difference to them.<a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I wish you’d told me before. I felt that something was worrying you and
I didn’t know what.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>If I saved the crop there didn’t seem any use fussing, and if I didn’t
you’d know quite soon enough.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>How could you bear to let me put the flowers here?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess I didn’t mind if it made you happy. You didn’t know they was
only a weed. You thought them darned pretty.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little smile.</i>] It was very kind of you, Frank.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess it’s queer that a darned little flower like that should be able
to do so much damage.</p>

<p>Why didn’t you tell me you’d written to Eddie?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess I forgot.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Frank, Eddie brought me some letters from home to-day. I’ve had the

<p>Very.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>A little surprised at his manner.</i>] Have you any objection?</p>

sit looking at the prairie and sometimes I wanted to scream at the top
of my voice just to break the silence. I thought I should never escape.
The shack was like a prison. I was hemmed in by the snow and the cold
and the stillness.<a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] You seem in a great hurry to be rid of me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess we ain’t made a great success of married life, my girl.... It’s
rum when you come to figure it out. I thought I could make you do
everything I wanted. It looked as if I held a straight flush. And you
beat me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what you mean.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess I didn’t know how strong a woman could be. You was always givin’
way, you done everything I told you&mdash;and all the time you was keepin’
something from me that I couldn’t get at. Whenever I thought to put my
hand on you, I guess I found I’d only caught hold of a shadow.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what more you wanted.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

back.</p>

and run over for the winter.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess that would be a dangerous experiment. You’ll be a lady in
England, and I guess I’d be just the hired man.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>You’d be my husband.<a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a></p>

All sorts of qualities which I used to value seem very unimportant to me
now. You’ve taught me a great deal.</p>

to do it.</p>

<p>You’ve never been unkind to me, Frank. You’ve been very patient with me.</p>

you’re warm and comfortable at home and you’ve got plenty to eat.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, I know it&mdash;I should think I did. [<i>As she pictures to herself

hot water. And I shall get up, and I shall have breakfast, and I shall
interview the cook. I shall order luncheon and dinner. And I shall brush
the<a name="page_154" id="page_154"></a> coats of Mrs. Hubbard’s poms and take them for a walk on the
common. All the paths on the common are asphalted so that elderly
gentlemen and lady’s companions shouldn’t get their feet wet.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Gee!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>And then I shall come in and lunch, and after luncheon I shall go for a
drive, one day in this direction and one day in that. And then I shall
have tea, and then I shall go out again on the nice neat asphalt paths
to give the dogs another walk. And then I shall change my dress and come
down to dinner. And after dinner I shall play bezique with my employer,
and I must take care not to beat her because she doesn’t like being
beaten. And at ten o’clock I shall go to bed.... [<i>She pauses a
moment.</i>] At eight o’clock next morning a maid will bring in my tea and
hot water, and the day will begin again. Every day will be just like
every other. And there are hundreds of women in England, strong and
capable, with blood in their veins, who would be eager to get the place
that’s offered to me. Almost a lady and thirty-five pounds a year.</p>

land. And who knows what starving child may eat the bread that has been

useless, but you will have done something worth while.</p>

<p>When I was talking to Mrs. Sharp just now I don’t know what I said, I
was just trying to comfort her because she was crying, and it seemed to
be someone else who was speaking, and I listened to myself. I thought I
hated the prairie through the long winter months, and yet somehow it has
caught hold of me. It was dreary and monotonous, and yet I can’t get it
out of my heart. There’s a beauty and a romance in it which fill my soul
with longing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quietly.</i>] I guess we all hate the prairie sometimes, but when you’ve
once lived in it, it ain’t easy to live anywhere else.<a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>I know the life now. It’s not adventurous and exciting. For men and
women it’s the same hard work from morning till night, and I know it’s
the women who bear the greater burden. The men go into the towns, they
have shooting now and then, and the different seasons bring them
different work. But for the women it’s always the same, cooking,
mending, washing, sweeping. And yet it’s all got a meaning. We, too,
have our part in opening up the country. We are its mothers and the
future is in us. We are building up the greatness of the nation. It
needs our courage and strength and hope, and because it needs them, they
come to us. Oh, Frank, I can’t go back to that petty, narrow life. What
have you done to me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hoarsely.</i>] I guess if I asked you to stay now, you’d stay.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a low voice.</i>] You said you wanted my love. Don’t you know?... Love
has been growing in me slowly, month by month, and I wouldn’t see it. I
told myself I hated you. I was ashamed. It’s only to-day, when I had the
means of leaving you for ever, that I knew I couldn’t live without you.
I’m not ashamed any more. I love you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess I loved you from the beginning, Norah.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p><a name="page_157" id="page_157"></a>Why d’you say it as if...? What’s the matter, Frank?</p>

<p>I guess you’ll have to take that job in England. I can’t ask you to stay
on.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>The inspector’s condemned the crop. I’m bust.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Oh, why didn’t you tell me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>I guess I couldn’t. I made up my mind when I married you that I’d make
good. I couldn’t expect you to see that it was just bad luck. Anyone can
get the weed in his crop. But I guess a man oughtn’t to have bad luck.
The odds are that it’s his own fault if he has.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Now I understand about Eddie.</p>

<p>What are you going to do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>It’s all right for me. I can hire out. It’s you I was thinking of. I
felt pretty sure you wouldn’t go back to Ed’s. I didn’t fancy you taking
a position as lady help. I didn’t know what was to become of you, my
girl. And when you told me of the job in England, I thought I’d let you
go.<a name="page_158" id="page_158"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Without telling me you were in trouble?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>Why, if I wasn’t smashed up, d’you think I’d let you go? By God, I

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

<p>Are you going to give the land up?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Taylor.</span></p>

<p>No, I guess I can’t do that. I’ve put too much work in it. And I’ve got
my back up now. I shall hire out for the summer and next winter I can
get work lumbering. The land’s my own now, and I’ll come back in time
for the ploughing next year.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Norah.</span></p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
